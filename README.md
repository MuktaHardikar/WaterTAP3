# NAWI-WaterTAP3

The Water Technoeconomic Assessment Pipe-Parity Platform (WaterTAP3) was developed under the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI) to facilitate consistent
technoeconomic assessments of desalination treatment trains. The WaterTAP3 is an analytically robust modeling tool that can be used to evaluate water technology
cost, energy, environmental, and resiliency tradeoffs across different water sources, sectors, and scales. The model simulates steady-state water treatment train
performance and costs including flow and constituent mass balance across unit processes, based on source water conditions, configurations of treatment technologies, 
and system-level techno-economic assumptions. 

Users can build a new treatment train by connecting any number of unit processes, specific for their context and system, or selecting a train from the treatment 
train library. The model contains various technical and cost parameter options for a range of treatment processes and a library of influent water quality 
characteristics for a variety of source waters and case studies. Users can customize water quality parameters to evaluate the technology performance in their
context. The model can be set up for different assessment needs including simulation, optimization, and uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. 

The results from WaterTAP3 can help identify trade-offs among the different system performance metrics, with insight on how particular technologies or systems 
promote pipe-parity. The flexibility and comprehensive scope of the tool makes it a promising solution to industry-wide water technoeconomic evaluations, leading to 
more informed water investment decisions and technologies. As a user-friendly, open-source platform, WaterTAP3 can be used by industry, academia, policymakers, 
planners, and those with or without extensive analytical experience.
