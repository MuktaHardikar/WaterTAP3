Unit Models
###############


All unit processes achieve the mass balances described in the water recovery and constituent
removal section. The calculations of water recovery and constituent removal are based on factors
(in the data folder) or equations that represent some level of the physical processes that occur
in the treatment process. There are four levels of detail (discussed also in the Financials
section) across the unit models and the current status of the unit models is shown in the figure
below.
